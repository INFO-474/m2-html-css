## Exercise 2: Bootstrap
In this exercise, you'll practice leveraging common Bootstrap classes to build a mobile-first website. Because web-programming is a prerequisite to this course, we will not covering how to use these elements in great detail in class.  At this point, you should feel comfortable building modern looking mobile-first websites.   Here is what you are aiming for (desktop):

On a mobile view, the navigation bar should collapse to a standard hamburger menu view that presents options that drop down:

Also on a small screen, the body of the page (three columns of content) should each take up 100% of the width:
